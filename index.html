                    <h2>Why is Shakira the best?</h2>
                    <p>It’s unusual for an artist to be so talented internationally. Shakira is a globally famous,
                        acclaimed
                        vocalist
                        while also being an
                        incredible dancer, and performer. Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle -
                        the
                        sets,
                        the
                        choreography - and she sells out at all events internationally. Shakira has received several
                        awards
                        from
                        being Top in Billboards to
                        music videos, and grammy nominations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        She has sold over 95 million records, making her the best-selling female latin artist of all
                        time,
                        and
                        received twelve latin grammy awards.
                        You can call her Queen of Latin Music!
